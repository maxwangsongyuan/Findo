Vision
===============
This project aims to educate the general public about the financial world, unveiling the myths behind all financial decision makings

This a **full-stack website** that is dedicated to investors who are interested in financial investment. Our web application provides 6 main pages for our users to navigate around - Stock page, Financial Products Page, Structured Financial Investments page, User Login Page, and Company popularity page. In developing this handy application, we used **HTML** and **CSS** for the frontend, **Django** and **Python** for linking; **SQL**, and **MongoDB** for the backend databases.
 
Description
===============
Our web application offers the most premium services to our customers. Through the minimalist and user-friendly web design, users can easily search for certain financial products that they are interested in. 
 
In addition, this app facilitates users to document and manage their wealth via functions such as addition, deletion and renewal of their current possessions. Furthermore, we have built a stock price prediction system that enables our users to decide if they want to invest in certain products that are linked to stock prices. This function is dedicated to help our investors when they choose their structured financial product. Structured financial products are pre-packaged investments that normally include assets linked to interest plus one or more derivatives. By comparing their knock-out prices (decided by the banks) and the predicted future stock price, they can evaluate the riskiness of purchase as well as the profitability of the structured investment.
 
To further our research in the market, we implemented an analysis tool using the most widely used principal component analysis that helps the investors to get a better understanding of the market. Last but not least, our Company Popularity list will update our users latest trendy stocks in the market!<br /><br />
